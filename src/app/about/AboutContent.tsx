                  Pastor McKnight is not your typical government contracting consultant. He&apos;s a licensed
                  pastor who discovered his calling at the intersection of faith and federal procurement —
                  and he&apos;s been helping small businesses win government contracts ever since.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Based in South Carolina with deep roots in the community, Pastor McKnight brings over
                  15 years of experience in federal contracting, including SAM.gov registration, SBA
                  certification programs, bid and proposal writing, and contract compliance. He&apos;s helped
                  over 500 businesses collectively win more than $50 million in federal contracts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His approach is unique: combining hard-earned expertise with faith-driven values of
                  integrity, service, and genuine care for every client. Whether you&apos;re a veteran, a
                  woman entrepreneur, or a first-time contractor — Pastor McKnight meets you where you
                  are and takes you where you need to go.

                The Story Behind The Contracting Preacher
              </h2>

              <div className="space-y-6 text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <p>
                  The name &quot;The Contracting Preacher&quot; wasn&apos;t a marketing idea — it was born from lived
                  experience. Pastor McKnight spent years serving his community from the pulpit while
                  simultaneously building expertise in federal procurement. He saw too many talented,
                  hardworking business owners missing out on government contracting opportunities simply
                  because they didn&apos;t know the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So he made it his mission to bridge that gap. To take the complexity of SAM
                  registrations, SBA certifications, and government proposals and make them accessible.
                  To walk alongside small business owners with the same care and commitment he brings
                  to his pastoral work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, The Contracting Preacher serves clients across South Carolina and all 50 states.
                  Every engagement starts with a conversation — not a sales pitch. Because Pastor McKnight
                  believes that when you lead with service, success follows.
